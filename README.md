# dogecoin-price-notifications

This project is just a simple price notifications tool you can use for Dogecoin, or any other cryptocurrency you want.


It is built using Python, and it also incorporates the CoinMarketCap API, the IFTTT app, and the Telegram app. In addition, I built it so all you have to do is modify a few lines of code to get price alerts for whatever crypto you like.



If you want to build a similar project, start by getting the code. Once you have the code just go sign up with CoinMarketCap to get your API key, and do the same for IFTTT. Both accounts have free options. You'll also need to create a Telegram account if you don't already have one, which is also free.



From there, just drop in your API keys where I specify in the code, and change the parameters if you prefer to get notifications for a different crypto, such as Bitcoin. (If you need help finding the correct parameters, or if you are unfamiliar with the IFTTT app, feel free to message me as I am happy to help.)



This is a great project if you want to learn more about APIs and how they work, want to practice a bit with Python, or if you just really like cryptocurrencies like I do. Hope you all enjoy and have fun!
